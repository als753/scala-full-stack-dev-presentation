Commentary

[Jack with arms out]                    Meet Jack. Jack spends much of his day wishing life was more like Scala. 
[Jack with null coffee]                 In the morning, Jack feels like things would be much better with more options,
[Jack in lunch line]				            And by lunchtime, he's wishing the sandwich line could be more asynchronous.
[Jack going into wrong toilet]          His afternoon breaks would be much easier with some pattern matching.   
[Jack in loops]                         And he often finds himself going in loops on the way home without a map.
[Jack with Person[Jack] sign]           Sorry Jack but for now you're going to have to keep carrying round that type baggage.
[Scala bar + Try{scala}.recover(inBar)] Unless, you join us for "Scala for Full Stack Development: An Experience Report".
